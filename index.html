                <h3>Why We Swim</h3>
                <h4>Bonnie Tsui</h4>
                <p>
                    The title certainly describes the content, but there's a joy 
                    in this book that feels like a refreshing dip in our San Francisco Bay. 
                    Swimming is examined through many lenses: history, sociology, personal 
                    experience, literature, and so on. It's the perfect read for any 
                    quatic-loving mammal.

                <h4>Kim McCoy, Willard Bascom</h4>
                <p>
                    Here is a book I've been waiting a decade for--a revised and 
                    expanded edition of the classic primer on waves, tides, winds, 
                    and general ocean behavior. This new edition includes many charts 
                    and illustrations that make it more user-friendly than my tattered 
                    1979 paperback. Time and tide wait for no one; don't sleep on this one...

                <h4>Samantha Hunt</h4>
                <p>
                    If you’ve ever wanted to walk off into the cold, dark ocean, 
                    this book is for you. A contemporary fairytale, this book 
                    perfectly encapsulates the surreal desire we all feel on 
                    the edges of human existence. This book is the unknownable 
                    desire to walk peacefully into the crashing waves of a quiet 
                    grey beach far, far up the coast. Cold, dark, gentle, enveloping 
                    - the call of the void.

                <h3>Waterlog</h3>
                <h4>Roger Deakin</h4>
                <p>
                    In an attempt to discover his island nation from a new perspective, 
                    Roger Deakin embarks from his home in Suffolk to swim Britain—the seas, 
                    rivers, lakes, ponds, pools, streams, lochs, moats, and quarries. 
                    Deakin immerses himself in the natural habitats of 
                    fish, amphibians, mammals, and birds. The 
                    result of this surprising journey is a deep dive into modern 
                    Britain: its people, culture, its laws and customs, its 
                    communities, and especially its wild places.

                <h3>Barbarian Days</h3>
                <h4>William Finnegan</h4>
                <p>
                    When I first moved to the outer Sunset, my colleague/pal EH gave me a 
                    photocopy (or was it a mimeograph?) of a long New Yorker piece by 
                    William Finnegan on the early days of surfers at Kelly's Cove on 
                    SF's Ocean Beach. This piece is included, with updates, in 
                    Finnegan's Pulitzer-Prize winning autobiography documenting his 
                    life as a surfer/journalist. It's one of the very few books about 
                    surfing that appeal consistently to a non-surfing audience.
